# Metronic Tailwind Laravel

This is a Laravel project that uses the Metronic Tailwind template.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need to purchase the Metronic theme, which includes the Tailwind CSS source files. After purchasing, follow these steps:

### Installation

1. Copy the `src` folder from the `metronic-tailwind-html` package and paste it into the `resources` directory of your Laravel project. Rename the copied folder to `metronic` so that the directory structure should now look like this: `resources/metronic`. This step imports the necessary styles and assets from the original HTML package into your Laravel project.

2. Copy the `media` folder from the `metronic-tailwind-html` package's `dist/assets/media` directory into your Laravel project's `public/assets` directory. The resulting directory structure should look like this: `public/assets/media`.

3. Install the required Node.js packages by running `npm install` in the root directory of your Laravel project.

4. Build the assets by running `npm run dev` in the root directory of your Laravel project.

5. Start the Laravel development server by running `php artisan serve`.

That's it! You now have the Metronic Tailwind template integrated into your Laravel project.
